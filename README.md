Lorentz boosts with no weird stuff

`lorentz-boost` does one thing\* - boost a Cartesian four-vector into another four-vector's rest frame.
You just need to pass the x/y/z/t components of each vector.

Motivated by high-energy physics, where its easy to access arrays of particle x/y/z momentum and energy
It should also be easy to boost these particle momenta into the rest frame of another particle.

\*also boost several four vectors into different reference frame(s).
